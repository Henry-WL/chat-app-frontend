## About The Project

'ChatMe' is a full stack application allowing users to sign-up and add users to chat to in real-time. The application is fully responsive allowing use on mobile and desktop.

#### Built With

#### - React.js, Tailwind and DaisyUI

## Key Features

#### Authentication and Authorization with JWTs
The ChatMe app implements authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Upon login, the backend auth server issues a JWT, which is stored on the client-side. This token is sent in the request headers for routes that require authentication, ensuring secure access to protected resources.

#### Real-time Chat
Chatting with other users is the one of the key components of the app. After adding a user as a friend the two users can chat to each other in private. Other users will not be able to see their chat.

#### Editing Profile
Users can edit their own profile if they are logged in, changing their username, email and password are all available, all updates are shown in real time. If a user edits their username this will update across their chats.

#### Responsive Design
The app is designed to be responsive across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures optimal usability and accessibility regardless of screen size or device type.
